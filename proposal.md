# Challenge Introduction
Learning to rank (LTR) with implicit user feedback such as click data has received considerable attention in both academia and industry. 
On the one hand, implicit user feedback provides an abundant and sustainable source of relevance signals for LTR,  and we can obtain large-scale training data for ranking optimization without extensive human annotations. 
On the other hand, however, directly optimizing the model with click data will result in unsatisfied performance due to the strong bias on implicit user feedback.
