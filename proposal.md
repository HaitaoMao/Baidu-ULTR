# Challenge Introduction
Learning to rank (LTR) with implicit user feedback such as click data has received considerable attention in both academia and industry. 
On the one hand, implicit user feedback provides an abundant and sustainable source of relevance signals for LTR,  and we can obtain large-scale training data for ranking optimization without extensive human annotations. On the other hand, however, directly optimizing the model with click data will result in unsatisfied performance due to the strong bias on implicit user feedback. 

In particular, the position bias, which occurs because users are more likely to examine documents at higher ranks, is known to distort ranking optimization if not handled properly. Therefore, using unbiased learning to rank~(ULTR) to obtain ranking models that are immune to position bias is an important question for the IR community.
